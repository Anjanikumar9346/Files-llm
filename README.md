# Static Python Scripts for LLMs

These are the simplest Python files possible:
- No methods
- No functions
- Just straight-line code for easy parsing

## Files:

- `file1.py`: Prints a greeting using variables
- `file2.py`: Adds two numbers and prints the result
- `script.py`: Combines both greeting and addition logic

These files are designed for LLM ingestion, code correction, or education purposes.
